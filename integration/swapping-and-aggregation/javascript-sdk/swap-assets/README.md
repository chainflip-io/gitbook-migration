# Swap Assets

Chainflip swaps are **fire-and-forget**, meaning once the deposit is made, the user doesn't need to do anything for the swap to take place.&#x20;

There are two main ways to initiate a swap:

1. Creating a deposit channel via a _Broker_ and getting a deposit address.  See [request-deposit-address.md](request-deposit-address.md "mention").
2. Calling the `swap()` or `call()` functions of the Chainflip Vault contracts, for EVM-only chains. See [execute-swap.md](execute-swap.md "mention").
