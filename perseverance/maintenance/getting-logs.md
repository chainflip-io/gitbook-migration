# Getting Logs

We use [`journald`](https://sagan.readthedocs.io/en/latest/journald.html), which is systemd default log management service, to collect logs generated by the node and the engine. To interact with it, you'll use `journalctl`. Below are some useful commands when debugging your validator node.

## Journalctl 101

### Getting all logs for unit

```bash
journalctl -u chainflip-node.service
```

This will output all logs generated by that unit. You hit `space` to scroll through the logs from older to newer.

### Following logs

If you want to see logs in real time, run the following:

```
journalctl -f -u chainflip-node.service
```

### Using time ranges

To filter your logs using time ranges you can run the following:

#### Relative time range

```
journalctl -u chainflip-node.service --since "1 hour ago"
```

#### Specific time ranges

```
journalctl -u chainflip-node.service --since "2023-06-20 23:15:00" --until "2023-06-20 23:25:00"
```
